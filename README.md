🚀 Getting Started
------------------

To get started with each project, navigate to its directory and follow the specific `README.md` or documentation provided. Below are some basic commands to clone this repository and set up dependencies.

### Install Dependencies

Each project may have its own dependencies, so refer to the specific project’s `README.md` for installation instructions. For example:

bash

Copy code

`go mod init project-name go mod tidy`

📊 Monitoring and Load Balancing
--------------------------------

### Advanced Monitoring

Prometheus and Grafana are set up to monitor real-time metrics like cache hits, misses, latency, and node health. Follow these steps to view metrics:

1.  **Install Prometheus** and run `prometheus.yml` configuration.
2.  **Install Grafana**, add Prometheus as a data source, and import dashboards for deeper insights.

### Load Balancing with Nginx

Use the provided `nginx.conf` to set up load balancing across instances of specific services (e.g., Distributed Cache, Web Server). This configuration distributes incoming requests evenly across multiple server instances.
